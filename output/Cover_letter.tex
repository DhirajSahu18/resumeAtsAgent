\begin{letter}{Hiring Manager}
\opening{Dear Hiring Manager,}

I am writing to express my keen interest in the Software Engineer position at your company. With my background in computer science and hands-on experience in web-based software development, particularly using technologies like React.js, TypeScript, and PHP Laravel, I am confident I can make a significant contribution to your team.

My resume highlights my proficiency in several key areas relevant to this role, including front-end development with React.js and back-end development using Node.js and Express.js. I am also experienced in API design and Agile methodologies, as demonstrated during my internship at CCBUL LLP, where I designed and developed responsive front-end interfaces and optimized application performance, reducing page load times by up to 40\%. My experience includes contributing to API design and implementation for seamless data exchange between front-end and back-end systems.

Furthermore, I have a strong understanding of CI/CD concepts, which I believe is crucial for maintaining efficient and reliable software development pipelines. I am eager to apply my skills and contribute to your company's mission of creating innovative and high-quality software solutions.

Thank you for considering my application. I am excited about the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experience can benefit your team. I am available for an interview at your earliest convenience.

\closing{Sincerely,}
\signature{Dhiraj Sahu}
